# TEI-XML_assignment_3

This repository is composed of the three samples I decided to encode in my project. 

These samples are letters which come from three different epistolary works written and published in the second half of the modern era. They are organized as follows : 

- Text 1 : Letter XXX of _Lettres Persanes_, written by Montesquieu in 1721.
- Text 2 : Letter CLXXV of _Les Liaisons dangereuses_, written by Laclos in 1782. 
- Text 3 : Letter CXXVIII,  _From Madame de Sévigné to the Count of Bussy Rabutin_, written by Madame de Sévigné in 1671. 

I have chosen these texts because of my interest for this kind of literature, and for the historical era they come from. 

This repository contains : 

- The three encoded letters (XML files)
- "sources" folder, containing PDF versions of the letters
- Reflexive note 
- ODD customisation file 
- "out" folder, containing the RNG generated from the ODD
- HTML generated from the ODD
